# kudos_oss

## Setup
* Check python version: python --version
* Install virtual environment: python3 -m venv ~/Dropbox/code/kudos_oss (path to the directory). Running this command creates the target directory (creating any parent directories that donâ€™t exist already) and places a pyvenv.cfg file in it with a home key pointing to the Python installation from which the command was run (a common name for the target directory is .venv). 
* Go to target directory: cd kudos_oss/
* Install Flask: pip install -U Flask
